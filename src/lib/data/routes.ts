        question: 'How long does sea freight shipping take from Guangzhou to Prince Rupert?',
        answer: 'Sea freight shipping from Guangzhou to Prince Rupert typically takes 18-28 days for port-to-port transit. Direct services usually complete the journey in 18-22 days, while transshipment routes may require 24-28 days. Additional time should be allocated for customs clearance (2-4 days) and inland transportation to final destinations. Peak season congestion during summer and pre-holiday periods may add 2-5 days to standard transit times.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the costs for sea freight shipping from Guangzhou to Prince Rupert?',
        answer: 'Sea freight costs vary based on service level and shipment requirements. Economy service averages $1.45 per kg, standard service $1.95 per kg, and express service $2.80 per kg. Additional costs include fuel surcharges (10-15% of base rate), customs clearance fees ($150-300), documentation fees ($50-100), and terminal handling charges ($200-400 per container). LCL shipments incur consolidation fees, while FCL rates depend on container size and seasonal demand fluctuations.',

        question: 'What documents do I need for sea freight shipping from Guangzhou to Prince Rupert?',
        answer: 'Required documentation includes: Commercial Invoice with detailed goods description and values, Packing List specifying contents and weights, Bill of Lading as proof of shipment, Certificate of Origin for preferential duty treatment, Export License from Chinese authorities if applicable, and Canadian Import Permit for regulated goods. Additional documents may include Phytosanitary Certificates for agricultural products, Dangerous Goods Declaration for hazardous materials, and Insurance Certificate if cargo coverage is purchased.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does customs clearance work for shipments from Guangzhou to Prince Rupert?',
        answer: 'Customs clearance occurs at both origin and destination. In Guangzhou, Chinese customs requires export declaration submission 24 hours before vessel departure. At Prince Rupert, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) processes imports using Advance Commercial Information (ACI) pre-arrival data. Clearance typically takes 1-3 business days for standard cargo, with possible inspections adding extra time. Licensed customs brokers handle documentation submission, duty payments, and regulatory compliance to ensure smooth clearance processes.',

      {
        question: 'Can I track my sea freight shipment from Guangzhou to Prince Rupert?',
        answer: 'Yes, comprehensive tracking is available throughout the shipping process. Real-time updates include container loading at origin, vessel departure from Guangzhou port, transit milestones, arrival at Prince Rupert, and customs clearance status. Tracking information is accessible through online portals, mobile apps, and email notifications. GPS-enabled containers provide precise location data during ocean transit, while port integration systems offer detailed status updates during loading and discharge operations.',

      {
        question: 'What cargo insurance options are available for Guangzhou to Prince Rupert shipments?',
        answer: 'Comprehensive marine cargo insurance covers goods against physical loss or damage during transit. Coverage options include All Risks policies protecting against most perils, or Named Perils coverage for specific risks like fire, collision, or general average. Insurance premiums typically range from 0.2-0.5% of cargo value. Claims processing requires prompt notification, damage surveys, and supporting documentation. Higher-value shipments may require additional security measures and enhanced coverage terms.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the packaging requirements for sea freight from Guangzhou to Prince Rupert?',
        answer: 'Proper packaging must withstand ocean transit conditions including humidity, temperature variations, and container movement. Requirements include moisture-resistant materials, adequate cushioning for fragile items, and secure strapping or blocking for heavy cargo. Wooden packaging materials require IPPC treatment certification. Dangerous goods need UN-specification packaging with proper labeling. Container loading requires weight distribution compliance and securing methods to prevent shifting during the 18-28 day voyage across the Pacific.',
