The Port of Shanghai handles over 47 million containers annually, ensuring reliable weekly departures and excellent connections with major shipping lines like COSCO, Evergreen, and OOCL. Once your containers reach Montreal, the established trucking networks and rail connections provide smooth final delivery to Ottawa's growing logistics hub, making this route ideal for businesses prioritizing cost savings over speed.",
    "rates": "Current sea freight rates from Shanghai to Ottawa in 2026 typically range from $2,800 to $4,200 for a standard 20-foot container (FCL), while 40-foot containers cost between $3,500 and $5,800 depending on seasonal demand and carrier selection. Less than container load (LCL) shipments generally run $180 to $280 per cubic meter, though rates can spike during peak seasons from August through October when retailers stock up for holiday sales. Additional costs include a bunker adjustment factor of roughly $400-600 per container, Canadian customs clearance fees averaging $150-250, and trucking from Montreal to Ottawa adding another $800-1,200 to your total landed cost. Smart shippers reduce expenses by booking during slower periods like January through March, consolidating smaller shipments to qualify for FCL rates, and working with freight forwarders who maintain strong relationships with multiple carriers serving this trans-Pacific route.",
    "transitTimes": "Ocean transit from Shanghai to Montreal typically requires 22 to 27 days of sailing time, with your cargo then needing an additional 3 to 5 days for customs clearance and ground transportation to reach Ottawa. Standard service operates on weekly schedules with most major carriers, while premium services can shave 2-3 days off total transit by using faster vessels and priority handling at both ports. Customs processing in Montreal usually moves efficiently for properly documented shipments, though complex cargo or missing paperwork can extend clearance by several additional days. Expedite your shipment by ensuring all commercial invoices, packing lists, and certificates of origin are accurate and submitted electronically before your vessel arrives, and consider working with a Canadian customs broker who understands Ottawa's specific import requirements. Planning for the full 32-day window protects your business from weather delays, port congestion, and the occasional extended customs inspection that can affect any international shipment."

    "rates": "Current 2026 sea freight rates from Hong Kong to Melbourne range from $1,200 to $1,800 per 20-foot container (FCL) and $45 to $65 per cubic meter for less-than-container-load (LCL) shipments.

Additional charges include bunker adjustment factor (BAF) at roughly 15% of base rates, port handling fees of $180-220 per container, and Australian customs examination fees averaging $85 when inspections occur. Smart shippers reduce costs by consolidating smaller shipments into full containers when possible and booking during shoulder seasons in February through April.

    "transitTimes": "Ocean vessels typically complete the Hong Kong to Port of Melbourne journey in 14-18 days of actual sailing time, depending on weather conditions and the number of intermediate port calls.

Express services with fewer port stops can reduce total door-to-door delivery to 16-18 days, while economy services with multiple transshipments may extend to 24-26 days. Accelerate your clearance process by ensuring all documentation reaches your Australian customs broker at least 48 hours before vessel arrival, and consider using trusted trader programs like Australia's Trusted Trader scheme for faster processing. Peak season congestion at Port of Melbourne during October and November can add 1-3 days to cargo release times, so factor this into your supply chain planning."
